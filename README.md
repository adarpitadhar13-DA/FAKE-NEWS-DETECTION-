üì∞ Fake News Detection using Natural Language Processing (NLP)
üåü Introduction
Welcome to the Fake News Detection repository!

In the age of information, the rapid spread of misinformation poses a significant challenge. This project aims to combat this issue by building a robust Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) model to classify news articles as either 'Real' or 'Fake' based purely on their textual content.

This is a Binary Text Classification problem that showcases the complete end-to-end ML workflow, from raw text data to a deployed prediction service.

‚ú® Features
Natural Language Processing (NLP): Utilizes key NLP techniques like tokenization, stop-word removal, and stemming/lemmatization.

Feature Engineering: Conversion of raw text into numerical features using advanced methods like TF-IDF Vectorization (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency).

Model Training: Comparison of multiple classification algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines).

Deep Learning (Optional): Integration of advanced models like LSTM or BERT (if applicable).

Evaluation: Comprehensive model assessment using metrics vital for classification tasks (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score).

Deployment (Optional): A user-friendly web application for real-time news classification using [Flask/Streamlit/etc.].
